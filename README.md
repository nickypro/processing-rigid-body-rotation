# processing-rigid-body-rotation

A Rigid-Body simulation program in Java Processing. 
To use, simply clone the files and open in Processing.

Includes some sample 3D Objects that import well into processing.
(It seems like many .obj files do not work well with Processing)

Uses an implementation of the algorithm by
